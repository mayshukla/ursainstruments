## The Sarangi

This is an experimental instrument that I built for myself.
Although this instrument is not for sale I am open to custom orders for sarangis or other similar Indian instruments.
Please reach out if you have an idea you'd like to discuss!

A Sarangi is an Indian stringed instrument.
It usually has three strings that are played with a bow and several smaller sympathetic strings.
Sympathetic strings are not played directly but resonate along with the main strings.
This sarangi is a mix of tradition and my own ideas.

The body is a single piece of walnut that I carved by hand.
The neck is maple with a decorative walnut veneer at the top.
The design of the veneer is inspired by Mughal architecture.

The skin is deer rawhide.
It is stretched over the body in a similar construction to a tackhead banjo.
This deer hide came from indigenous hunters who hunt for food and don't use the hides.
I also painted a peacock on the skin.

The bridge is a piece of maple that was hand-carved to resemble the traditional shape of sarangi bridges (also they are usually made of bone).
This shape is meant to be a very stylized elephant.

I used gold-plated guitar and bass tuners rather than the old-fashioned friction peg tuners commonly used in Indian instruments.
I find these more convenient even though they're not traditional.
As a bonus, I think the gold hardware looks nice!
