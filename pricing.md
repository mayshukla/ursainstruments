Custom inlay:
Typically I do a simple end graft on the rim (unless it is one piece of wood) and an "Ursa Major" inlay on the twelfth fret.
Other inlays are possible for an extra price. The price depends on the complexity of the inlay and the material to be inlaid.
This can be discussed on a case by case basis.
