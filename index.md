Ursa Instruments is a one-woman operation based in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

Currently, I make open-back banjos but I am planning on expanding to other types of instruments in the future. Follow me on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ursa.instruments" target="_blank">instagram</a> to see what's available.

I also take repairs and custom commissions! See the <a href="/pricing.html">pricing</a> page for more info.
