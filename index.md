Ursa Instruments is a one-woman operation based in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

Currently, I make open-back banjos but I am planning on expanding to other types of instruments in the future. Check out the "Shop" page to see what's available.

I also take custom commissions.
If you have an idea for a woodworking and/or instrument project, don't hesitate to reach out!
