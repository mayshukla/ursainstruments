Handmade instruments and crafts.

Wildrose Instruments is a one-woman operation based in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

Currently, I make banjos and also other small wooden crafts. Check out the "Shop" page to see what's available.

I also take custom commissions.
If you have an idea for a woodworking and/or instrument project, don't hesitate to reach out!
